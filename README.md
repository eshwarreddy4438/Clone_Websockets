# Cloning Data using web sockets from different servers 

Open bash and clone the data 
command - git clone repository link 

Install websockets in bash and in VScode 
command - pip install websockets 

Open the folder in the repository and run the sender-websocket and then the reiver-websocket 

Then we can see the ouput of the name of the files that are copied and also the content in those files 

The same steps go for the second stage as well
