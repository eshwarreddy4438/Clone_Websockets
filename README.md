# Cloning Data using web sockets from different servers 

Open bash and clone the data 
-with os libraray in python

Install websockets in bash and in VScode 
command - pip install websockets 

Open the folder in the repository and run the sender-websocket and then the reiver-websocket 

Then we can see the ouput of the name of the files that are copied and also the content in those files 

The stage 2:
Used gemini api to successfully transfer files and content to directory from server to receiver

Improvements:
Rather than local server we wanted work the server on different computers
